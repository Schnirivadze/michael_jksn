Marlon joined the team at the same time, and the group of five groups was renamed The Jackson 5. The father raised the children, maintaining strict discipline, and used force in cases where something was not selective with him. Jackson grew up spending a lot of time in the studio, in rehearsals and meetings, the almost indistinguishable meaning of getting out and getting together with other children in the park. Despite the rough and oppressive methods of education, Michael always thanked his father for instilling in him the determination, in front of the public and accustomed him to strict discipline, which played a big role in Jackson's future success. At the age of 8, the boy became a two-soloist in the team.</p>

In the early 80s. Off the Wall became Michael's best-selling album at the time. The record was highly acclaimed by critics, with most reviewers agreeing that Jackson showed himself to be a grown-up, mature artist on it. The compositions in the album were sustained in the genres of rhythm and blues, funk, soul and disco. The first single from Off the Wall, "Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough", earned the singer his first Grammy and two American Music Awards. At the end of August 1979, Jackson turned 21, the contract between him and his father as a manager ended, and the singer gained independence from Joseph.

                      <p>When, in 1981, Paul McCartney explained to Jackson how to profit from buying the publishing rights to songs, Paul McCartney became very interested in this idea and almost immediately began acquiring the rights to various compositions. The catalog, containing about 200 songs by The Beatles and approximately 4,000 compositions by other authors, was then owned by ATV Music Publishing. In 1981, McCartney and Yoko Ono made an attempt to buy The Beatles songs from there, but the then owner of ATV, Lew Grade, agreed to sell only the entire catalog at once for $ 30 million. As a result, the deal fell through as Ono and McCartney pulled out of the deal. The news that the ATV catalog was up for sale did not reach Jackson until September 1984. The musician expressed a desire to purchase it, and in order to avoid conflicts, the singer's lawyers contacted representatives of McCartney and Yoko Ono and received an answer that the purchase of the catalog was not planned in the near future. Before starting negotiations with the singer, the owners of the catalog also gave McCartney the first right to buy the rights, but he once again refused. Jackson's lawyers began a 10-month campaign to acquire the publishing rights, and, beating competitors, Jackson became the owner in mid-August 1985 for $47.5 million.</p>

                    <p>Since the mid 80s. Jackson began work on songs for the new record, he recorded his demos in his home studio in Encino in order to gain as much control as possible over the upcoming material, more creative freedom. The already far from ideal relationship between the musician and the producer stretched even more, and Bad became their third and last collaboration. It took the musician and producer 18 months to prepare the album and the promotional campaign for it, the release of the disc was postponed several times. Finally, in July 1987, the first single was released - "I Just Can't Stop Loving You" - and on August 31 the album was released. The list of songs on the disc included songs in the genres of funk, rhythm and blues, gospel, pop and hard rock, jazz, swing and blues. Reviews from critics ranged from "the singer's apparent growing confidence and autonomy as a producer and songwriter" to "the complete loss of Jackson's creative independence, stifled by the influence of Quincy Jones". The Thriller record by that time had become a kind of measure of the musician's creativity: most critics evaluated Jackson's subsequent albums, comparing them with her. Only a few reviewers noticed that it is incorrect to draw such analogies and consider each record separately.</p>

About 2 hours later, Murray returned to find his patient lying on the bed with his eyes and mouth wide open. The doctor tried to resuscitate the singer, but the attempts were unsuccessful. At 12:21 local Pacific time, a call to 911 was recorded. Arriving after 3 minutes and 17 seconds, the doctors found Jackson no longer breathing with a stopped heart and immediately began cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Efforts to bring Michael Jackson back to life continued along the way and for an hour after arriving at the UCLA Medical Center at 1:14 p.m. These attempts were unsuccessful. Death was pronounced at 14:26 local time. The news of his death received publicity in the first minutes after the incident.</p>
